# Verified Commands

Record commands that have been verified in this repository.

Format:

- YYYY-MM-DD: `command` - what it checks or does, plus any caveats.

- 2026-11-02: `openspec init --tools claude --profile custom` - created `openspec/` and the twelve
  `openspec-*` skills, with no commands, because the global config (`openspec config list`)
  already sets `delivery: skills` and all twelve workflows. CLI 1.14.3. Regenerate the skills
  with `openspec update`; do not hand-edit them.
